# IMDBMovieRatingPrediction

By harnessing data science techniques, I aim to predict the IMDb ratings of movies prior to release or shortly thereafter, offering valuable insights for industry stakeholders. Through analysis of diverse movie features such as genre, cast, director, and budget, we seek to build accurate predictive models that illuminate audience preferences and industry dynamics. This project not only aids decision-making in the film industry but also showcases the potential of data-driven approaches in understanding complex phenomena.
